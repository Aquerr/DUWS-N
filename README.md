# DUWS-N
ArmA 3 Dynamic Universal War System - N

*A fork of DUWS-R.*

## Overview
DUWS-N randomly generates a campaign with enemy zones to capture. You can also choose to manually place your HQ and enemy
zones to make your own unique campaign. The key of this mission is to have maximum replay-ability, where the player can
setup their own campaign or let the DUWS-N create everything randomly for them. You can play with the DUWS-N on any
island you want, you just have to rename the .pbo file.

**What is so special with DUWS-N and how does it differ from DUWS-R?**

DUWS-N is an *improved version of DUWS-R* that provides better support for dedicated servers, allows all squad leaders to request missions, provides better AI and more.
Take a look at the list of features below to learn more.

### Quick Start
Put the .pbo inside your `Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 3\Missions` and/or `Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 3\MPMissions` folder.
When you are asked to choose the campaign settings, just use the default parameters until you are ready to start changing the settings.

### Required Add-ons:
None! You can play ArmA III vanilla or use all the add-ons you want: islands, weapons, gear, etc... Note that the DUWS-N
will not show add-ons that adds BLUFOR units/vehicle, since they are added by hand. However, add-ons that add OPFOR vehicles
will be used, since OPFOR vehicles are taken directly from the cfgVehicles classes.

### Using the mission on another island
Just rename the .pbo to the extension of the other island. That's it! Consideration should be taken when doing this as some
islands cause more load when generating zones and other items due to the terrain being sloped. Most terrain is fine but islands
such as diaoyu can me it difficult to play
 * Example: DWS.stratis.pbo >> DWS.chernarus.pbo

### Manually placing zones
After a location for the HQ has been selected the player will be prompted with a dialog with various options. Two buttons
will be available at that time. `START-R` and `START-M` allow you to place enemy zones randomly or manually respectively.

## Features
 * Play the way you want:
   * Play as a lone wolf or as a special forces team, using support assets and gadgets and perform side missions
   * Control your personal squad of troopers and fight against the OPFOR
 * Pretty much every location is randomly generated on the map, from the HQ to enemy zones and side missions.
 * Random side missions, with randomly generated names
 * Play the DUWS-N on any island you want to.
 * VAS by Tonic (Armory)
 * Several support options to unlock (UAV, Arty, Personal FLIR, VAS, ...)
 * You can define the HQ location yourself and the enemy zones, or just the HQ and let the DUWS-N generate the zones automatically. You can also let the DUWS-N create everything by itself. Basically you decide the level of randomization.

#### New features
 * Dedicated server support
 * DUWS Admin Support Menu
 * New AI
 * And more...
